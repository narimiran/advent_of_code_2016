## Solutions

First ten puzzles were solved as they were published, then came the infamous [Dec 11 task](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/11), which crushed my hopes and motivation.  
After some desparation, I've managed to solve first 20 puzzles before Christmas, then took a long break and finished all challenges on March 19th 2017.

Comments, suggestions and critiques are welcome.
